To run, and view this driver- you will need to:

1. Use tail to watch the kernel log:
  sudo tail -f /var/log/kern.log

2. Use insmod to load the driver.ko:
  sudo insmod lkm_device.ko

3. Watch the kernel log, and note down the major number
  e.g. 241

4. Change directory into /dev and make a new node using the major number
  sudo mknod lkm c 241 0

5. This will now function as a device, which you can, for example, cat to get
  the "99 Red Balloons" output in text, transferred from kernel to userspace.
